# AnalogClock
This is an analog clock with some additional features such as different time zones, a digital clock and date display.
The heart of the project is the idea that in relation to the center point of the clock the x and y values of the other elements can be described using sinus(for the x value) and -cosinus(for the y value). The positioning of all elements of the clock aswell as the movement of the hands is built on that. 
This was a project for my A-Level exam in computer sciences. I'm from Germany which is why the initial time zone is set to Europe/Berlin.
The way variables/methods etc. are ordered within the classes might seem a bit unconventional, this was done to make it easier to present in school.
